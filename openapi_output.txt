Terms of use for the scite API can be [found here](https://scite.ai/apiterms).

# Overview & Terminology

| Target and Source | In our API, we refer to the source as the publication making the  citation and the target as the publication receiving the citation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tallies           | Tallies are counts of citations for a particular target including how  much a publication has been supported, contradicted, or mentioned. The counts for `total`, `supporting`, `contradicting`, `mentioning` and `unclassified` reflect the number of citation statements made toward the DOI. The count `citingPublications` reflects the number of distinct publications which cite the DOI. This distinction is important because there can be more than one citation statement from a publication. Please note, in our UI and other places we refer to contradicted as contrasted but in our API we refer to it as contradicted. |
| Papers            | Papers are the metadata about publications including basic things such  as DOI, title, date of publication and more.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Search*           | The search API allows querying scite's publication metadata and citation data. Citation sources can be queried both by publication metadata such as year, journal and so on, as well as the content of their citation snippets and where/how they occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Reference Check*  | We provide an API for our reference checking capability where a  publication can be submitted and its references can be evaluated and  linked using scite's data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| References*       | In our API 'references' refers to what are traditionally called 'citations'. These objects are distinct pairs of source and target DOIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The scite badge provides an easy way to integrate scite.ai on your site
without touching the API directly.

For more details please see the [Badge Documentation](https://scite.ai/badge)

# Authentication

Scite Endpoints require tokens in order to be used (aside from tallies and papers endpoints). Please contact sales@scite.ai for more information.

The default rate limit is up to 10 requests per second, up to 40 requests per minute.

The `/tallies/{{doi}}`, `/tallies/aggregate` and `/papers/{{doi}}` endpoints are uncapped.

Authentication tokens can be passed be used on the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <my-token>
```

For example:

```bash
$ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer token' 'https://api.scite.ai/reference_check/tasks/123/cancel'
```

This can be used to access restricted endpoints or bypass rate limits.

If you would like to obtain an authentication token for heavier or advanced API usage please contact us at [hi@scite.ai](mailto:hi@scite.ai).

# Assistant API

The assistant API consists of two endpoints:
- [POST /api_partner/assistant/poll](#post-apipartnerassistantpoll) for starting an assistant task
- [GET /api_partner/assistant/tasks/{task_id}](#post-apipartnerassistanttaskstask_id) for polling the task

Both endpoints require an authorization header with a valid JWT token issued by scite with the correct scope.

## POST /api_partner/assistant/poll

```bash
curl 'https://api.scite.ai/api_partner/assistant/poll' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \
  --data-raw '{"turns":[{"role":"user","content":"How does the structure of a protein affect its function?"}],"user_input":"How does the structure of a protein affect its function?","session_id":null,"alwaysUseReferences":false,"neverUseReferences":false,"abstractsOnly":false,"fullTextsOnly":false,"numReferences":25,"rankBy":"all","answerLength":"medium","yearFrom":"","yearTo":"","topics":[],"journals":[],"publicationTypes":[],"citationStyle":"ieee","dashboards":[],"referenceChecks":[],"dois":[]}' \
  --compressed
```

## Request Body

For a single turn use of assistant it is suffecient to use a turn structure like this:
```JSON
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": "How does the structure of a protein affect its function?"
}
```
Multiple turns can be provided by adding more turn objects to the `turns` array.


## Request Response

The response will consist of a `{ id: task_id }` which can be used to poll the task.


## GET /api_partner/assistant/tasks/{task_id}
```bash
curl 'https://api.scite.ai/api_partner/assistant/tasks/{task_id}' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_TOKEN>' \
  --compressed
```

## Request Response

The response will consist of a status indicating the status of the task.
You will need to poll the task until the status is `SUCCESS`.
While the task status is not `SUCCESS` the response will contain a `info` field with information about the current state of the task such as the currently generated content, search strategies, and search.

## Using Tables Mode

You can use tables mode by setting `useStructuredResponse` to true in the request body of the POST /api_partner/assistant/poll endpoint.

## Using rankBy Parameter
The `rankBy` parameter allows you to control how results are ranked and sorted in your API queries. You can specify this parameter to tailor the ordering of results according to your needs.
Possible values for `rankBy` are:
- `all`: A combinatino of the below factors.
- `relevance`: Sorts results by relevance to the query.
- `date`: Sorts results by publication date (most recent first).
- `citations`: Sorts results by the number of citations.
- `supporting-citations`: Sorts results by the number of supporting citations.
- `contrasting-citations`: Sorts results by the number of contrasting (contradicting) citations.
- `journal-rank`: Sorts results by the rank or impact of the journal.
Example usage in a request body:
```json
{
  "query": "example query",
  "rankBy": "relevance"
}
